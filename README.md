# dividingStudentsIntoGroups

A program for dividing students into study groups according to optimization criteria: 
1) maximizing the similarity of the total score in groups;
2) maximizing the similarity of the average score in groups;
3) minimizing the maximum value of the Gini index among all groups;
4) maximizing the similarity of the dividing into groups compared to the previous dividing;
   
Integer programming models and greedy algorithms are implemented.
